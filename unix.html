        The roots of Bell Labs lay in the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T),
        which became the parent organization of Bell Telephone System. Founded by Alexander Graham Bell in the 1870s, by 1910.Since the early 1900s Bell Telephone Laboratories, or Bell Labs, has been a major source of technological experimentation and change. Bell Labs has sponsored research far beyond the limits of its original focus, the telephone.
         From telephones to radar to computers, the scientists at Bell Labs have had a hand in the most important inventions of the 20th century.

           Dennis Ritchie was born in Bronxville, New York, in 1941. He graduated from Harvard University
           with degrees in physics and applied mathematics and with a Ph.D. in mathematics (1968). His contributions to computing span four decades
           and have had global impact. While at Bell Labs' Computing Sciences Research Center in the early 1970s, he created the C programming language
           and co-developed (with Ken Thompson) the UNIX operating system-both of which are foundations of our modern digital world.<br />
           The C programming language and its descendants continue to be used to write the software that makes digital devices and networks work,
           while UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems run on a vast range of computing systems.<br />
           Ritchie's early work laid the foundations for much of the technical infrastructure of our modern digital world. He enjoyed traveling and
            reading, but his main passion was his work, and he stayed with Bell Labs until his retirement in 2007. With Ken Thompson, he was awarded the
            ACM Turing Award (1983), the U.S. National Medal of Technology (1999), and the Japan Prize (2011). He passed away in 2011.<br />

             Ken Thompson was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1943. He received a B.S. (1965) and M.S. (1966) in electrical engineering and computer
             science from UC Berkeley.<br />
             In 1969, Thompson and colleague Dennis Ritchie created the UNIX operating system at Bell Telephone Laboratories. UNIX was a scaled-down
             version of the MIT MULTICS operating system, one meant to run on the new smaller minicomputers becoming available at the end of the 1960s.
             When re-written in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie, UNIX became a truly portable operating system capable of running on many
             different hardware platforms. The C language itself was widely adopted and is in wide use today.<br />
             UNIX, which has had numerous incarnations since its inception, has become the backbone of the computerized technical infrastructure of the
             modern world. UNIX or its variants run on devices as different as supercomputers and smartphones and as enormous as global banking networks
             and military systems.<br />
             The longevity, reliability, and security of UNIX reflect the excellence of its design as it has been adapted to modern use. Thompson won
              the ACM Turing Award (1983), the U.S. National Medal of Technology (1999), and the Japan Prize (2011), all with Dennis Ritchie.

               In order to define UNIX, it helps to look at its history. In 1969, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and others started work on what was to
               become UNIX on a "little-used PDP-7 in a corner" at AT&T Bell Labs. For ten years, the development of UNIX proceeded at AT&T in numbered
               versions. V4 (1974) was re-written in C -- a major milestone for the operating system's portability among different systems. V6 (1975) was
               the first to become available outside Bell Labs -- it became the basis of the first version of UNIX developed at the University of California
               Berkeley.<br />
               Bell Labs continued work on UNIX into the 1980s, culminating in the release of System V in 1983 and System V, Release 4 (abbreviated SVR4)
               in 1989. Meanwhile, programmers at the University of California hacked mightily on the source code AT&T had released, leading to many a
               master thesis. The Berkeley Standard Distribution (BSD) became a second major variant of "UNIX." It was widely deployed in both university
               and corporate computing environments starting with the release of BSD 4.2 in 1984. Some of its features were incorporated into SVR4.<br />
               As the 1990s opened, AT&T's source code licensing had created a flourishing market for hundreds of UNIX variants by different manufacturers.
               AT&T sold its UNIX business to Novell in 1993, and Novell sold it to the Santa Cruz Operation two years later. In the meantime, the UNIX trademark
               had been passed to the X/Open consortium, which eventually merged to form The Open Group.<br />

               While the stewardship of UNIX was passing from entity to entity, several long-running development efforts started bearing fruit.
                Traditionally, in order to get a BSD system working, you needed a source code license from AT&T. But by the early 1990s,
               Berkeley hackers had done so much work on BSD that most of the original AT&T source code was long gone. A succession of programmers,
                starting with William and Lynne Jolitz, started work on the Net distribution of BSD, leading to the release of 386BSD version 0.1 on
                 Bastille Day, 1992. This original "free source" BSD was spun out into three major distributions, each of which has a dedicated following:
                  NetBSD, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD, all of which are based on BSD 4.4.2<br />
                 BSD wasn't the first attempt at a "free" UNIX. In 1984, programmer Richard Stallman started work on a free UNIX clone known as GNU
                (GNU's Not UNIX). By the early 1990s, the GNU Project had achieved several programming milestones, including the release of the GNU C library
                and the Bourne Again SHell (bash). The whole system was basically finished, except for one critical element: a working kernel.

                   Enter Linus Torvalds, a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland. Linus looked at a small UNIX system called
                   Minix and decided he could do better. In the fall of 1991, he released the source code for a freeware kernel called "Linux" -- a
                   combination of his first name and Minux, pronounced lynn-nucks.3 By 1994, Linus and a far-flung team of kernel hackers were able to
                   release version 1.0 of Linux. Linus and friends had a free kernel; Stallman and friends had the rest of a free UNIX clone system:
                   People could then put the Linux kernel together with GNU to make a complete free system. This system is known as "Linux," though
                   Stallman prefers the appellation "GNU/Linux system."4 There are several distinct GNU/Linux distributions: some are available with
                   commercial support from companies like Red Hat, Caldera Systems, and S.U.S.E.; others, like Debian GNU/Linux, are more closely aligned
                   with the original free software concept.<br />
                   The spread of Linux, now up to kernel version 2.2, has been a startling phenomenon. Linux runs on several different chip
                   architectures and has been adopted or supported to varying extents by several old-line UNIX vendors like Hewlett-Packard,
                   Silicon Graphics, and Sun Microsystems, by PC vendors like Compaq and Dell, and by major software vendors like Oracle and IBM. Perhaps
                   the most delicious irony has been the response of Microsoft, which acknowledges the competitive threat of ubiquitous free software but
                   seems unwilling or unable to respond with open-source software of its own.

                     Microsoft has, however, struck blows with Windows NT (Windows 2000). During the late 1990s, vendor after vendor has abandoned the
                      UNIX server platform in favor of Windows NT or wavered in their support. Silicon Graphics Inc., for example, has decided that Intel
                      hardware and NT is the graphics platform of the future.<br />
                     The phenomenon of old-line UNIX vendors jumping ship and the concurrent rush to Linux by vendors large and small brings us back to
                      the question at the top of this section: What is UNIX? While one can abide by the legal definition as embodied in the trademark, I
                      believe that this does a major disservice to the industry. As the base software of the Internet, UNIX technology is one the
                      significant achievements of 20th century civilization. To restrict it to a narrow legal or technical definition -- as formulated by
                      some of the vendors now abandoning it -- is to deny its ongoing relevance and importance, which is most evident in the amazing
                      popularity and strength of UNIX-like clones such as GNU/Linux and BSD.<br />
