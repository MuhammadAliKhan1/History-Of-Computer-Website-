        The roots of Bell Labs lay in the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T),
        which became the parent organization of Bell Telephone System. Founded by Alexander Graham Bell in the 1870s, by 1910.Since the early 1900s Bell Telephone Laboratories, or Bell Labs, has been a major source of technological experimentation and change. Bell Labs has sponsored research far beyond the limits of its original focus, the telephone.
         From telephones to radar to computers, the scientists at Bell Labs have had a hand in the most important inventions of the 20th century.

           Dennis Ritchie was born in Bronxville, New York, in 1941. He graduated from Harvard University
           with degrees in physics and applied mathematics and with a Ph.D. in mathematics (1968). His contributions to computing span four decades
           and have had global impact. While at Bell Labs' Computing Sciences Research Center in the early 1970s, he created the C programming language
           and co-developed (with Ken Thompson) the UNIX operating system-both of which are foundations of our modern digital world.<br />
           The C programming language and its descendants continue to be used to write the software that makes digital devices and networks work,
           while UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems run on a vast range of computing systems.<br />
           Ritchie's early work laid the foundations for much of the technical infrastructure of our modern digital world. He enjoyed traveling and
            reading, but his main passion was his work, and he stayed with Bell Labs until his retirement in 2007. With Ken Thompson, he was awarded the
            ACM Turing Award (1983), the U.S. National Medal of Technology (1999), and the Japan Prize (2011). He passed away in 2011.<br />

             Ken Thompson was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1943. He received a B.S. (1965) and M.S. (1966) in electrical engineering and computer
             science from UC Berkeley.<br />
             In 1969, Thompson and colleague Dennis Ritchie created the UNIX operating system at Bell Telephone Laboratories. UNIX was a scaled-down
             version of the MIT MULTICS operating system, one meant to run on the new smaller minicomputers becoming available at the end of the 1960s.
             When re-written in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie, UNIX became a truly portable operating system capable of running on many
             different hardware platforms. The C language itself was widely adopted and is in wide use today.<br />
             UNIX, which has had numerous incarnations since its inception, has become the backbone of the computerized technical infrastructure of the
             modern world. UNIX or its variants run on devices as different as supercomputers and smartphones and as enormous as global banking networks
             and military systems.<br />
             The longevity, reliability, and security of UNIX reflect the excellence of its design as it has been adapted to modern use. Thompson won
              the ACM Turing Award (1983), the U.S. National Medal of Technology (1999), and the Japan Prize (2011), all with Dennis Ritchie.

           Besides assembler and Fortran, UNIX also had an interpreter for the programming language B. ( The B language is derived directly from Martin
           Richards BCPL). The language B was developed in 1969-70 by Ken Thompson. In the early days computer code was written in assembly code. To perform
            a specific task, you had to write many pages of code. A high-level language like B made it possible to write the same task in just a few lines
            of code. The language B was used for further development of the UNIX system. Because of the high-level of the B language, code could be
            produced much faster, then in assembly.
           A drawback of the B language was that it did not know data-types. (Everything was expressed in machine words). Another functionality that the B
           language did not provide was the use of “structures”. The lag of these things formed the reason for Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the programming
           language C. So in 1971-73 Dennis M. Ritchie turned the B language into the C language, keeping most of the language B syntax while adding
           data-types and many other changes. The C language had a powerful mix of high-level functionality and the detailed features required to program
           an operating system. Therefore many of the UNIX components were eventually rewritten in C (the Unix kernel itself was rewritten in 1973 on a DEC
           PDP-11).

             The programming language C was written down, by Kernighan and Ritchie, in a now classic book called “The C Programming Language, 1st edition”.
             (Kernighan has said that he had no part in the design of the C language: “It’s entirely Dennis Ritchie’s work”. But he is the author of the
             famous “Hello, World” program and many other UNIX programs).<br />
             For years the book “The C Programming Language, 1st edition” was the standard on the language C. In 1983 a committee was formed by the American
             National Standards Institute (ANSI)
             to develop a modern definition for the programming language C (ANSI X3J11). In 1988 they delivered the final standard definition ANSI C.
             (The standard was based on the book from K&R 1st ed.)<br />
             The standard ANSI C made little changes on the original design of the C language. (They had to make sure that old programs still worked with
             the new standard). Later on, the ANSI C standard was adopted by the International Standards Organization (ISO). The correct term should there
             fore be ISO C, but everybody still calls it ANSI C.
