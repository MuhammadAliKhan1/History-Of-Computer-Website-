         David Packard and Bill Hewlett found their company in a Palo Alto, California garage. <br />
         Their first product, the HP 200A Audio Oscillator, rapidly became a popular piece of test equipment for engineers. <br />
         Walt Disney Pictures ordered eight of the 200B model to test recording equipment and speaker systems for the 12 specially equipped <br />
         theatres that showed the movie “Fantasia” in 1940.

           HP spun off a small company, Dynac, to specialize in digital equipment. <br />
           The name was picked so that the HP logo "hp" could be turned upside down to be a reverse reflect image of the logo "dy" of the new company. Eventually Dynac changed to Dymec, then was folded back into HP in 1959.[15] HP experimented with using Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) minicomputers with its instruments, but after deciding that it would be easier to build another small design team than deal with DEC, HP entered the computer market in 1966 with the HP 2100 / HP 1000 series of minicomputers. These had a simple accumulator-based design, with registers arranged somewhat similarly to the Intel x86 architecture still used today. The series was produced for 20 years, in spite of several attempts to replace it, and was a forerunner of the HP 9800 and HP 250 series of desktop and business computers.

            In 1984, HP introduced both inkjet and laser printers for the desktop.
            Along with its scanner product line, these have later been developed into successful multifunction products,
            the most significant being single-unit printer/scanner/copier/fax machines. The print mechanisms in HP's tremendously popular LaserJet
            line of laser printers depend almost entirely on Canon Inc.'s components (print engines), which in turn use technology developed by Xerox.
            HP develops the hardware, firmware, and software that convert data into dots for the mechanism to print.

              In 1997, HP sold over $120 million worth of its printers and computer products to Iran
              through a European subsidiary and a Dubai-based East distributor, despite U.S.
              export sanctions prohibiting such deals imposed by Bill Clinton's executive orders issued in 1995.
              This triggered a sanction by SEC to which HP responded that products worth US$120 million were sold in fiscal year 2008
              for distribution by way of Redington Gulf, a company based in the Netherlands, and that as these sales took place through a foreign subsidiary, HP had not violated sanctions.
              At that time, Redington Gulf had only three employees whose sole purpose was to sell HP products to the Iran market
              According to former officials who worked on sanctions, HP was using a loophole by routing their sales through a foreign subsidiary
              HP ended its relationship with Redington Gulf after the SEC inquiry

                   On April 28, 2010, Palm, Inc. and Hewlett-Packard announced that HP would buy Palm for $1.2 billion in cash and debt.
                   Before this announcement, it was rumored that either HTC, Dell, Research in Motion or HP would buy Palm. Adding Palm handsets to the HP product line created some overlap with the iPAQ series of mobile devices but was thought to significantly improve HP's mobile presence as iPAQ devices had not been selling well. Buying Palm gave HP a library of valuable patents, as well as the mobile operating platform known as webOS. On July 1, 2010,
                   the acquisition of Palm was final.
                   The purchase of Palm's webOS began a big gamble –
                   to build HP's own ecosystem.
                    On July 1, 2011, HP launched its first tablet named HP TouchPad, bringing webOS to tablet devices. On September 2,
                    2010, HP won its bidding war for 3PAR with a $33 a share offer ($2.07 billion) which Dell declined to match. After HP's acquisition of Palm, it phased out the Compaq brand.
